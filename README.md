# Hi, I'm Danilo. 🎧💻

I'm a **Technical Audio Artist** and **Audio Integration Engineer** based in Vancouver, BC. 

I live at the intersection of creative sound design and low-level systems engineering. I don't just want to know how a sound *feels*; I want to know exactly how the engine handles the pointer that triggers it.

### 🔍 What I’m doing right now
* **Battlefield (EA/Frostbite):** Currently auditing technical parity between manual test flows and C# autotest frameworks.
* **Sonus Flow:** Developing a specialized audio tool (C++/DSP) focused on accessibility and streamlined creative workflows.
* **Literacy:** Constantly refining my C++ and C# skills within complex game engine architectures.

### 🛠 The Toolkit
* **Languages:** C++, C#, Python, SQL.
* **Engines/Middleware:** Frostbite, Wwise, FMOD, Reaper (API/Scripting).
* **The "Unique Beast" Factor:** I bridge the gap between "I have a creative vision" and "Here is the architectural fix to make it possible."

### 📜 The Tenets
I am guided by a few simple principles: if it involves audio, requires code, and keeps me on my toes, I'm interested.
