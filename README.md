# Hi, I'm Danilo Siqueira. 🎧💻

I am an **Technical Sound Designer** and **Audio Integration Engineer** based in Vancouver, BC. 

My background is a fusion of creative sound design and technical systems implementation. I specialize in bridging the gap between high-level design intent and engine-side execution.

### 🔍 Current Focus
* **Audio Engine Architecture:** Currently working within the Frostbite engine ecosystem to optimize and validate technical audio pipelines for AAA titles.
* **Sonus Flow:** Developing specialized C++/DSP tooling focused on modernizing audio workflows and accessibility.
* **Technical Literacy:** Continuous exploration of C++ and C# within large-scale, distributed game engine environments.

### 🛠 The Toolkit
* **Languages:** C++, C#, Python, SQL.
* **Frameworks/Middleware:** Game Engine Architecture, Wwise, FMOD, Reaper API.
* **Approach:** Ensuring structural integrity and technical parity across complex audio systems.

### 📜 The Tenets
Guided by the Five Tenets: If it involves audio, requires code, and demands a rigorous technical eye, I'm in.
